# -Cancer-Predictive-Modelling
Predicting Cancer as Benign/Malignant using classification techniques in machine learning.


## Objective
Objective of this project is to classify the dataset for Benign/Malignant Cancer with highest accuracy possible.
This is proposed to be achieved through machine learning techniques.  


## Dataset
Dataset is extracted from scikit-learn library as "load_breast_cancer".  
The copy of UCI ML Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset is downloaded from: https://goo.gl/U2Uwz2  

## Library used:  
Pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn and sklearn

## Classification Techniques used:
Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machine (SVC).
